# 🔐 RSA Encryption Utility

A simple web-based tool to **generate RSA key pairs, encrypt messages, and decrypt ciphertext** — all inside your browser using the Web Crypto API.
This project demonstrates how RSA encryption works and is hosted on **GitHub Pages** for easy access.

## ✨ Features

* Generate RSA key pair (2048-bit, RSA-OAEP with SHA-256).
* Export keys in Base64 format.
* Encrypt text using the generated public key.
* Decrypt text using the generated private key.
* Runs **100% locally in your browser** (no server needed).
